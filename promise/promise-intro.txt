Promise is a JS Object which is used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

For Example, Mohan Promises Sohan to meet on sunday. So, Promise has 3 Stages :
1) Pending
2) Resolved : If Mohan meets Sohan on sunday.
3) Rejected : If Mohan does not meet Sohan on sunday.

If promise is Resolved, resolve() function is called which further calls then() function.
If promise is Rejected, reject() function is called which further calls catch() function.

Note : then() and catch() are callback functions.

Steps :
1) Create Promise Object
2) If promise is resolved, call resolve() function & futher call then() function.
3) If promise is rejected, call reject() function & further call catch() function.
