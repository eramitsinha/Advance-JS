What is Ajax?
- Ajax stands for Asynchronous Javascript and XML.
- It is a technology used to perform task without page refresh.
- Ajax is used to send request to the web server and get response.
- For using Ajax, we need 2 files, first file will send request and second file is web server file which will return response.

XMLHttpRequest :
- It is an object that is used to send request to the web server.
- Syntax : variable = new XMLHttpRequest();

XMLHttpRequest Built-in Functions :
1) open(method,url,async) :- 
This function is used to open the connection with the web server. It accepts three parameters :
(i) method - GET/POST
(ii) URL - web server file name
(iii) async - True / False (True is recommended)

2) send() :-
This function is used to send request to the web server.

open() and send() functions are used together.

XMLHttpRequest Built-in Properties :
1) onreadystatechange :- It keeps tracking the state of response.
2) readystate :- It defines the current state of the request. It includes five steps:
0 : request not initialized
1 : server connection established
2 : request received
3 : processing request
4 : response ready

3) status :- It returns response status. Following are status code :
200 - OK
403 - FORBIDDEN
404 - NOT FOUND

4) responseText :- It will return response in form of string.

5) responseXML :- It will return response in form of XML.

STEPS TO USE AJAX IN JAVASCRIPT :
1) Create an Object of XMLHttpRequest.
2) Establish connection and send request using open() and send() functions.
3) Keep tracking the request state and display response if status code is "200".
4) Fetch and display the response.
